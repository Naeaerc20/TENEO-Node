4. Add proxies to proxies.txt file with format socks5://login:pass@ip:port
5. Add your accounts data to userdata.json file
6. Now apiKey is always "OwAG3kib1ivOJG4Y0OCZ8lJETa6ypvsDtGmdhcjB" this is default paramet for userdata.json
7. Use proxies from https://www.922proxy.com/ - to have 24 hours IP duration so this makes the code works better.

Usually TENEO Should drop points every 15 minutes so just keep the code running and it will handle any disconneciton issues + retries.

Good Luck fam!
