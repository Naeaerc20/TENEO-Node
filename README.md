Step 1: - https://prnt.sc/SlANYrAjr-uu
Step 2: - https://prnt.sc/ssVjxFCnrPrB
3. Generate a random list of proxies from 2CAPTCHA and make sure to set them as "undetectable"
Example: https://prnt.sc/JQYVf943MmvX
4. Add proxies to proxies.txt file with format socks5://login:pass@ip:port
5. Add your accounts data to userdata.json file
6. Now apiKey is always "OwAG3kib1ivOJG4Y0OCZ8lJETa6ypvsDtGmdhcjB" this is default paramet for userdata.json
7. Use proxies from https://www.922proxy.com/ - to have 24 hours IP duration so this makes the code works better.
(If you use proxies from 922proxy select these: https://center.922proxy.com/Dashboard/LongActingTraffic - set time on 1440 minutes (24 hours) and save them on "default_proxies.txt" then use "converter.js" and it will be converter to the necessary format and saved on "proxies.txt" if you use 2captcha this step is not necessary

Usually TENEO Should drop points every 15 minutes so just keep the code running and it will handle any disconneciton issues + retries.

Good Luck fam!
